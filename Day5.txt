Lists in HTML | Fork HTML
Lists are used to store data or information in web pages in ordered or unordered form. HTML supports several types of list elements that can be included in the <BODY>tag of the document. These elements may also be nested, i.e, the onset of elements can be embedded within another. There are three types of list are available in HTML:

Unordered List

Description list

Now before moving to the list first of all we understands what is a list item tag.

Syntax:

<li  value = number>

An ordered list defines a list of items in which the order of the items are matters. An ordered list is also called a number list. The ordering is given by a numbering scheme, using Arabic numbers, letters, roman numerals. Or in other words, ordered list  tag is used to create ordered list.
