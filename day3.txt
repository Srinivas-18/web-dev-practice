Container and Empty Tags
HTML uses predefined tags that tell the browser how to display the content. Tags are nothing but some instructions that are enclosed in angle braces(i.e., <>). Tags are used in many places of the webpage but many users are often confused about some tags whether it is a container or an empty tag. They get this confusion because they don’t know for what tag there should be an ending tag along with the opening tag or not. 

There are two types of tags in HTML:

Empty
Container

Now, let us see the definitions and examples of the most commonly used HTML container and empty tags.

Container tags:
Container tags are generally divided into three parts, i.e., opening tag, content(which will display on the browser), and closing tag. In the content part, they can also contain some other tags. These opening and closing tags are used in pairs which are start tag and end tag, which is often called ON and OFF tags. If you forget to close the container tag, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page. So be careful while working with container tags. The majority of tags present in HTML are container tags.
