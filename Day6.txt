HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to properly display the content on the screen. And form is one of them. So, in this article, we will learn what is exactly HTML form what are the elements of forms and how can we use HTML form in our webpage. 

What is HTML <form>?

<form> is a HTML element to collect input data with containing interactive controls. It provides facilities to input text, number, values, email, password, and control fields such as checkboxes, radio buttons, submits buttons, etc. or in other words, form is a container that contains input elements, like text, email, number, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc. Forms are generally used when you want to collect data from the user. For example, a user wants to buy a bag online, so he/she has to first enter their shipping address in the address form and then add their payment detail in the payment form to place an order.

Forms are created by placing input fields within paragraphs, preformatted text, lists and tables. This gives considerable flexibility in designing the layout of forms. 

Syntax:

<form>
  <!--form elements-->
</form>

    </p>

    
<p>
      <label>Password : <input type="password" /></label>

<p>
       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </p>

  </form>
</body>
</html>
